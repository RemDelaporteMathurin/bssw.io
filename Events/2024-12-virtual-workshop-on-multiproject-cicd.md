### Summary

The Multi-ProjectDevOps project was founded to establish best practices for
decreasing the time needed to deploy multiple high-quality scientific software
packages, particularly when the packages share common requirements. Key to
these best practices are maintaining continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Since the managed packages share common
requirements the CI/CD workflows will too. We define a multi-project CI/CD
workflow as a CI/CD workflow that can be reused for multiple projects. The
purpose of this workshop is to share best practices, lessons learned, and
solutions for multi-project CI/CD.

### Themes
