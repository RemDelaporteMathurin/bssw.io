### Summary

Scientific software is becoming increasingly modular. While this is a boon for reuse, it can lead to maintenance headaches. In particular, the more software
an organization develops the more continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) workflows they must maintain. With an increase in modular software,
it is anticipated that many organizations will find themselves managing CI/CD
for a number of projects. Since these projects are developed by the same 
organization, these CI/CD workflows tend to have common needs that can be
addressed by common solutions.

We founded the [MultiprojectDevOps project](https://multiprojectdevops.github.io) in order to establish best practices 
for developing and maintaining multiproject CI/CD workflows. While there are a
number of online resources covering best practices of CI/CD for a single 
project, resources dedicated to the maintenance of multiproject CI/CD are more 
scarce. The goal of this workshop is to bring together CI/CD maintainers in 
order to identify challenges encountered in developing multiproject CI/CD and to 
share potential solutions. 

### Themes

- DevOps
- Multiproject CI/CD
- Sustainable software

### Logistics

The workshop will be held virtually on Google Meet on June 14, 2024 from 1:00-3:00 CST.

### Registration

Registration is free. To sign up please fill out this [registration form](https://forms.gle/b4xwFW1UKa7GfySw7)

### Contributing

The organizers welcome contributions in two forms:

1. Contributed presentation, or
2. [Request for Information](https://forms.gle/sG1m1RF5PrhgvE9W7)

Participants are welcome to contribute both a presentation and to answer the 
request for information. 

If you are interested in contributing a presentation, simply provide an abstract
when registering. Depending on the number of abstracts received the organizers
may need to down-select. Participants whose abstracts are selected for
presentations will be notified by May 30, 2024.

### Agenda

The exact agenda will be available at the beginning of June 2024 and will depend on the contributed abstracts and RFI. We anticipate a mix of
contributed talks, a summary of the request for information, and one or more panel discussions on topics from the RFI.
