### Abstract

<p>As the reach and impact of open-source software continue to grow, the ability to assess and improve the long-term sustainability of open-source software projects is paramount. This talk describes the Kitware Software Sustainability Matrix (SSM), a simple set of metrics designed to evaluate the sustainability of software projects and indicate ways to improve. By examining key values—Impact, Risks, Community, and Technology—we provide a structured approach to assess and enhance software sustainability. Kitware has been involved in open-source software production for over 25 years. We are continuing to develop and understand the key drivers that allow for software to be maintained for the long term. We are working with CORSA to help develop scorecards for the Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs). Additionally, we have partnered with organizations such as the University of Utah to improve the impacts of their software systems and ensure they remain vital into the future. In this presentation, we will describe the SSM and other efforts to measure and evaluate sustainability. We will also present use cases to demonstrate our progress in this area.</p>
