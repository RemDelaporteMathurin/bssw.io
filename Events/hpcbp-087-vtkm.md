### Abstract

<p>VTK-m is a visualization library designed for processing on modern HPC systems. Nearly all DOE HPC scientific visualization software relies on VTK-m to compute on GPU accelerator processors from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. Consequently, VTK-m is integrated into several production software products including ParaView, VisIt, and Ascent, and VTK-m has been used to provide visualization services for multiple simulation products including WarpX and XGC. In this talk, we will discuss the software engineering that allowed the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) to bring VTK-m from a research code to a production system. This talk will cover the basic software development methods used, the tools and tricks used, and some of the most helpful features of VTK-m for developers and users. The talk will also discuss some of the more problematic aspects of porting to ECP hardware and how these were overcome.</p>
