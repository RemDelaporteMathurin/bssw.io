### Description

Do you develop software for your research? Do you have some basic skills but desire more?

If so, you might be interested in the upcoming URSSI Summer School in Research Software Engineering. 
Building off our [pilot workshop](https://urssi.us/blog/2020/01/29/report-from-the-urssi-winter-school-pilot/) in December 2019 and a 
[recent winter school](https://urssi.us/blog/2023/10/31/applications-now-open-for-the-2024-urssi-winter-school-in-research-software-engineering/) held in January 2024, 
[URSSI](https://urssi.us) and the [GWU Open Source Program Office](https://library.gwu.edu/ospo) are hosting a three-day workshop on research software engineering skills 
over 24–26 June 2024 in Washington, DC, on the campus of George Washington University.

This is aimed at early-career researchers, particularly graduate students and postdocs, who are familiar with basic skills such as interacting with the Unix shell, 
version control using Git, and Python programming, and would like to learn more about best practices for developing research software.

The call for applications is now open through March 31, 2024.

### Program Curriculum

This three-day, hands-on workshop will expose participants to a series of topics necessary for developing sustainable research software. Topics to be covered include:

* Software design and modularity
* Collaborative software development via GitHub
* Software testing in Python
* Peer code review
* Packaging and distributing Python software
* Documentation
* Licensing
* Reproducibility
* Open science practices, including software citation

The school will consist of lectures on these topics along with open hacking time to allow participants to practice the concepts covered in the lectures. 
To facilitate the hands-on experience, each participant will bring a project to work on throughout the course to apply these concepts.
