We are a team of researchers from the FORCOLAB at the University of Toronto (UofT), directed by Prof. Shurui Zhou. We are conducting a research study on understanding the refactoring practices and challenges in open-source scientific software. This study is led by PhD student Rohith Pudari. Our initial findings indicate that **the current software engineering refactoring tools are unable to accurately detect refactoring instances in many scientific software repositories.** Therefore, we are trying to reach out to practitioners from scientific software teams about their experience in performing refactoring and their needs during the refactoring process. The main objective is to better support refactoring tasks during scientific software development. The study has received approval from the Research Ethics Board at UofT. 

We would greatly appreciate it if you could share your refactoring experiences in open-source scientific software by completing this survey (linked here).  your input will help us understand the refactoring practices in scientific software.  

The survey should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. Your feedback is invaluable, and your participation would be greatly appreciated. 

We would also appreciate it if you could also spread this request to other researchers and scientific communities. Thank you for your attention and time!
