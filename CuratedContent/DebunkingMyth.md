Paper title | Debunking the Myth that Upfront Requirements are Infeasible for Scientific Computing Software
Authors | Spencer Smith, Malavika Srinivasan, and Sumanth Shankar
Publication | Year 2019, DOI: [10.1109/SE4Science.2019.00011](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/SE4Science.2019.00011)



The paper **Debunking the Myth that Upfront Requirements are Infeasible for Scientific Computing Software** addresses the widely held belief in the Scientific Computing Software (SCS) field that defining requirements in advance is impractical. The authors contend that with an appropriate mindset, methodologies, templates, design processes, and tools, establishing upfront requirements is not only feasible but also advantageous. Benefits include enhanced communication, early error detection, improved design choices, and increased replicability. To demonstrate these concepts, the paper presents a case study involving software development for simulating the solidification of molten metal alloys. The authors highlight that upfront requirements are crucial for enhancing the quality and dependability of scientific software, advocating for the necessary effort to implement them.

This paper is an  asset for those engaged in SCS development, offering a thorough approach to upfront requirements while dispelling prevalent myths and objections. By adopting the recommended principles and practices, SCS developers can boost the efficiency, productivity, and accuracy of their software development processes.
