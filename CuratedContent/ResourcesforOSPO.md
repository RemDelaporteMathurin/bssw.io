Focus | Success for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs)

In some organizations the governance and guidance for open source projects fall under the purview of an Open Source Program Office.
The community is beginning to stand up resources to enable sharing knowledge and guidance for the creation and success of an OSPO.
The resources outlined in this article will help an organization to create an OSPO and to aid in the success of existing OSPOs.
The resources are also useful for anyone who manages, maintains, or guides open source projects.
There are even resources for open source developers, especially in the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).

Github is one of the main sites for hosting open source projects.
The purpose of [Github OSPO](https://github.com/github/github-ospo), a GitHub site itself, is to help OSPOs be successful on GitHub.
The site includes information about policies for releasing and publishing open source software, guides for repositories and much more.

[OSPO Alliance](https://ospo-alliance.org/) is an open community aimed at sharing knowledge and experience throughout the community. The alliance develops and maintains the OSS Good Governance Initiative (GGI) and hosts the GGI Handbook for setting up and managing OCPOs. The site includes upcoming OSPO OnRamp meetings and links to previously recorded meetings.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) are various guides that will be helpful to anyone involved in open source projects.
