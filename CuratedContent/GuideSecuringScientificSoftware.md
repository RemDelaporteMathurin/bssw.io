The [Guide to Securing Scientific Software](https://zenodo.org/records/8137009),
living document, is published by [Trusted: CI, the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence](https://trustedci.org), to help scientific software developers understand and ameliorate possible security gaps in scientific software and for those leading projects to understand what resources may be required to improve scientific software security.

The guide is an introduction to understand topics for secure software development with a list of resources for deeper dives into each topic. It describes possible threats and presents best practices for secure software development for the scientific community. The guide has been designed to be a tutorial, used as a whole, or as a guide to a particular topic of interest. Many of the topics point to video lessons on the Trusted CI website.
