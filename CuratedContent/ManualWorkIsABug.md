## Manual Work is a Bug

<!-- deck text start -->
Work to automate routine computing processes in an incremental appraoch, starting by documenting the manual steps and then incrementally automating larger and larger pieces of the process using developed software/scripts.
Continuing to do routine processes with manual execution is a bug!

Paper Title | Manual Work is a Bug
Authors | Thomas A. Limoncelli
Publiation | [ACM Queue, March 14, 2018, Volume 16, Issue 1](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520)

Thomas A. Limoncelli's article emphasizes the importance of automation in systems administration.
He contrasts two engineers: one successful due to a mindset of constant automation, and the other unsuccessful because he (thinks) he can never find time to automate.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Mindset and Documentation**: The successful engineer starts by documenting processes, treating these documents as pseudocode. Each manual iteration refines this documentation, transforming it into automated scripts over time.
* **Collaborative Documentation**: Using collaborative tools like wikis or Git repositories enables team members to contribute and improve documentation, promoting a culture of continuous improvement.
* **Four Phases of Automation**:
  1. **Document Steps**: Create detailed documentation of the process as you do the steps manually, and manually validate them along the way (investigating differnet options and problem solving along the way).
  2. **Create Automation Equivalents**: Going back over the process manually, add exact command-line snippets to documentation and they stablize.
  3. **Create Automation**: Developing scripts and storing them in a version control system.
  4. **Create Self-Service Systems**: Building web-based tools for user self-service and autonomous systems to minimize human intervention.
Cultural Shift

Adopting this approach requires a cultural shift where every manual task is an opportunity to move incrementally toward automation.
This mindset reduces stress, improves efficiency, and makes systems more reliable and easier to manage.

Limoncelli argues for a disciplined approach to automation, where every manual iteration contributes to better automation.
By fostering a culture of documentation and collaboration, IT teams can make significant strides towards fully automated systems.
