The ACM Diversity and Inclusion Council emphasizes the significant impact of language in the computing profession through their article [Words Matter](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter). 
This effort aims to replace offensive or exclusionary terminology with alternatives that are clearer and more inclusive. 
Examples of exclusionary words include "master/slave," "blacklist/whitelist," and "blind review". 
The Council collaborates with major organizations like IBM, Apple, and Github. 
The article recommends alternatives such as "primary/secondary," "allowlist/blocklist," and "anonymous review", respectively. 
The suggested changes not only avoid potentially offensive language but also often result in clearer, more precise terminology.
The article webpage also invites readers to participate in this initiative and submit exclusionary terms for evaluation and consideration to be added to the list.

This initiative is valuable to readers as it offers practical steps to enhance communication and foster inclusivity in their professional practices. 
Although changing terminology is just a first step, it helps create a more welcoming environment and raises awareness, essential for addressing deeper social injustices.
By adopting these recommended terms, professionals can contribute to a culture of respect and inclusion in the computing field.
