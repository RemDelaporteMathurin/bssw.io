If *diversity* is being asked to the scientific computing party, *inclusivity* is being asked to dance.

> Inclusivity [in scientific computing] is about practices to ensure people with diverse identities and experiences have equitable access to resources and opportunities, feel safe, welcomed, respected and valued, and are encouraged to contribute as their full, authentic selves in any particular group or activity. [Tony Baylis](https://people.llnl.gov/baylis3) -- LLNL Director of Strategic Diversity

Inclusivity and inclusive practices can play a role in improving almost every aspect of a scientific computing project.
The benefits include reducing barriers to adoption, increasing a product's reach, improving productivity, increasing innovation, attracting and retaining a wider talent pool, and improving job satisfaction.

Productivity of scientific computing projects is primarily impacted by the ability of people to work together, to collaborate ethically and trustfully, to communicate with clarity and empathy, to be inspired to contribute authentically and with enthusiasm and thoughtfulness.
Inclusivity and inclusive practices play a key role in facilitating all of that and more.
Likewise, the lack of attention to inclusivity and inclusive practices can dramatically negatively impact scientific productivity.

Setting the people aside and examining just the code we write we see that the scientific computing community invests significant effort in inclusivity...for code.
We labor to produce code that is portable, scalable, usable, interoperable, extensible, accessible, securable, etc.
All of these attributes are manifestations of inclusivity...for code.
It only makes sense that we would be equally committed, if not more so, to inclusivity for the people developing and using our code.

Inclusivity is [accessibilityâ€™s](https://www.inclusionhub.com/articles/a11y-at-salesforce) close cousin.

On BSSw.io, articles on the topic of Inclusivity are aimed at raising awareness of the role of inclusivity and inclusive practices in sustaining and improving scientific computing projects.
